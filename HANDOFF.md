# Inbar Mission Handoff

Generated deterministically from verified mission contracts, schemas, and append-only
research memory. Do not hand-edit this file.

## Resume identity

- Mission: `inbar` (Inbar)
- Owner: Daniel Wahnich
- Preferred command: `inbar`
- Legacy protocol namespace: `fieldtrue`
- Name status: `internally_adopted_pending_professional_clearance`

## Scientific state

- Iteration: `iter001_physical_causal_evidence_acquisition`
- Lifecycle stage: `corpus_qualification`
- Source-role verdict: `KILL_PUBLIC_SUBSTRATE`
- Source verdict event: `iter001-public-substrate-verdict-v1`
- Source verdict event hash: `e04bad2b2e053617127eb0a9c95953b22513d507a67ae059e152ff344bd9decd`
- Source verdict summary: No screened public source supplied the complete same-incident physical causal contract.
- Source architecture: physical admission, causal laboratory, independent reality and controls
- Compute consequence: GPU training remains blocked.
- Product boundary: Offline and shadow-mode evidence dossier compiler with human-reviewed safe-test ranking; no command authority.
- Canonical control authority: `bootstrap`
- Publication transition: `blocked`
- Active handoff: `inbar-authenticated-runner-recovery-handoff-v1` at sequence 102
- Active handoff event hash: `45c7bdef473969c03c916de5ebc74563bdc71b382b11a7d1a883dd8ee3c2a679`
- Handoff status: `blocked`
- State: Inbar remains in bootstrap with iter001-acquisition-contract blocked and no mission authority active.

`iter001-acquisition-contract` remains blocked. This handoff grants no authority.

## Linked checkpoint

- Checkpoint event: `inbar-authenticated-runner-recovery-checkpoint-v1`
- Checkpoint event hash: `64ea686d75e88994ae6dbd2e164b5d535cba3a144f5af1bfd498bead71485841`
- Implementation commit: `80c5e77275c0f7400ba8d43ca477476e09c19676`
- Action: Hardened the deterministic Inbar recovery contract and verified its internal consistency.
- Outcome: Recovery inputs and the blocked mission state are reproducibly bound to committed evidence.
- Authority effect: No authority was granted; iter001-acquisition-contract remains blocked.

## Remaining activation gates

1. signed mechanism ontology and biconditional prediction-key mappings
2. closed mechanism-target and target-subset schemas before affected truth access
3. signed extractor registry and complete feature inventories with opaque-media disposition
4. signed census, fold, rule-registry, release-plan, and freeze receipts
5. dedicated per-job X25519 generation, possession preflight, isolation, atomic durable global salt claims, and demonstrable process and key destruction
6. atomic no-replace publication and complete prepared, publication, open, and phase-completion receipt chains
7. global prediction barrier followed by fresh holdout-evaluation contexts without refitting
8. independent full-registry recomputation and target-manifest commitment reveal
9. V2 admission integration, new control-suite authority, and terminal binding
10. canonical fitted-execution wrapper for release receipt, operation count, time, resources, bytes, labor, and direct cost
11. signed target-independent input and provenance roots for selectors, features, local mappings, and chronology
12. prospective confirmation of candidate incident-list domains and final inner target-record shape

## Currently denied authorities

This explicit list is non-exhaustive. Every additional denial in committed
mission, safety, resource, claim, release, and publication contracts remains
binding.

Closing activation gates grants no authority automatically. Every affected
transition still requires its own prospective signed authority.

- production data access or download
- corpus admission
- target creation
- training
- GPU, cloud, paid provider, or other resource spend
- large dataset staging
- real-target evaluation
- physical action
- flight, live spacecraft, live robot, destructive test, deployment, or other live-system command authority
- financial operation or transaction
- credential, secret, key, or allowance operation
- truth release
- scientific verdict
- active-diagnosis performance claim
- recovery or safety claim
- cross-hardware transfer claim
- product or economic-value claim
- customer or commercial claims
- canonical seal
- publication
- repository visibility, licensing, or public code release

## Next action

- Complete and prospectively seal iter001-acquisition-contract before exercising any denied authority.

## Future research engine

- Policy: `deferred_to_separate_repository_after_multiple_complete_cycles`
- Boundary: The future research engine remains a separate repository and product, not Aweb, not Maestro, and not part of either control plane.
- Build timing: Continue extracting evidence during Inbar. Build the engine only after several complete mission cycles expose real correction, compute, and repeated-work paths.
